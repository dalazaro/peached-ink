My name is Kean Saetern, and thank you for viewing my website. By day, I work for a molecular diagnostics company to serve and better help cancer patients. From these experiences, I’ve learned that no matter what darkness has emerged, hope is a powerful ally. Hope creates positive thoughts, brings happiness, and is contagious. Hope comes from many different sources. For me, it’s the small things: colors, cute details, and simple joys that bring big smiles. It is my sincere hope that my artwork brightens dark days and inspires a bit color in everyone!", artist_statement: "Life captured in cute and simple art form.")
